BAGIS-H is Basin Analysis GIS for hydrologic response units (HRU). BAGIS-H allows users to delineate HRU zones,
refine these zones, and maintains a log of all the processing. The data layers are stored in ESRI's file
Geodatabase format.  

BAGIS-H is written using VB .NET on the .NET 4.0 platform. BAGIS-H is delivered to users as an ESRI ArcMap add-in and is
compatible with ArcMap 10.2.2 or higher. Most users define an area of interest (AOI) in BAGIS before using BAGIS-H
to generate HRU's. Output from BAGIS-H may be used in BAGIS-P for users needing to generate model parameters. 

BAGIS is maintained by a team of developers at Portland State University in cooperation with the USDA-NRCS National Water 
and Climate Center (NWCC)
